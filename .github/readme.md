# quansight writers workshop

the quansight writers workshop is a creative program focused on learning how to write literate programs. we will learn to strive for literary excellence in all of our works like blogs, white papers, code, and documentation. we'll supplement language and design with code to acheive interesting, eccentric stories.

the cirriculum is designed for all open source participants, one can get by mostly on markdown language alone. we explore writing for ourselves, others, and, the hardest of all, ourselves.

## grading

we have a hippy grade system where you grade yourselves. the classes worked will be collected into a single document that represents the groups collective works. you will be able to measure yourselves collectively, and be wildly impressed with the outcomes.

## syllabus

### week 1 -  the hardest class of all

writing about you! in this class we talk about the value of the readme file in general. it is a canonical piece of coding literature at this point, eat me, drink me.

homework - create your readme repository 

### week 2 - reading and writing literature with code

scientists, developers, and designers write in code STOP

there are few best practices when language and code collide, but there are style choices. this class is about exploring styles of writing that work for you.

#### homework

write a short story involving some language and some code in markdown, rst or notebooks.

### week 3 - peer review

the outcome of this class is about our collective efforts. when we write together, we read together, and publish together. it is important to provide actionable feedback to works that you share attribution with.

#### homework
